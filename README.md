Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Code changes`

These codes were presented in class to practice React logic and coding. After finishing the original code, I took the initiative to make some changes. Among the improvements, I modified how the project information is displayed — initially, the data was hardcoded — and also made some CSS adjustments to enhance the appearance.
